# Simple Linked List Implementation in C

This project contains a simple implementation of a Linked List data structure in C programming language.

## Features

- Create a new node
- Insert node at the beginning of the list
- Insert node at the end of the list
- Delete a node from the list
- Display list contents
- Memory management (free allocated memory)

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
gcc linked_list.c -o linked_list
./linked_list
```

## Expected Output

When you run the program, you will see:
1. Original List: 5 -> 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> NULL
2. List after deleting 20: 5 -> 10 -> 30 -> NULL

## Code Structure

The implementation includes:
- Node structure definition
- Basic linked list operations
- Memory management functions
- Example usage in main function
